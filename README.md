A Chrome extension for GitHub's [Saved Replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/using-saved-replies) that adds replies from a repository's `.github/replies.yml`.

Saved Replies are great, but oftentimes repository maintainers need a way to share common replies per-repository.
This extension modifies the Saved Replies for issues on any repository with a `.github/replies.yml` file to include those replies.

## Usage

In review for the Chrome Web Store now.
Until it passes, you'll need to [load unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) locally.

## Development

See [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), then [`.github/DEVELOPMENT.md`](./.github/DEVELOPMENT.md).
