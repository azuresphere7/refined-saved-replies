A Chrome extension for GitHub's [Saved Replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/using-saved-replies) that adds replies from a repository's `.github/replies.yml`.

Saved Replies are great, but oftentimes repository maintainers need a way to share common replies per-repository.
This extension modifies the Saved Replies for issues on any repository with a `.github/replies.yml` file to include those replies.

## Usage

Get it on [Chrome Web Store > Refined Saved Replies](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-saved-replies/ngcinicnlicdndmpcfjjifononfcceih)! âœ¨
